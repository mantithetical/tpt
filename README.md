# tpt-cli

`tpt cli` is written using the [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) library.
It currently supports the `detect-dialect` command only. `detect-dialect` naively
identifies if TpT resources contains American words, British words, both or 
none. 

Notes: 
* `NaiveDetector` tokenizes and singularizes input, drops non-letters and 
and performs a case-insensitive string-comparison to the corpora.
* The program does not account for tenses meaning `analyzed` would be ignored 
even though it is an American spelling.
* It does not try to capture intent in any way meaning spelling mistakes
 and alternate meanings of words are ignored. 
* Non-words are ignored. Hypens are acceptable.
* Compound words such as colorblind are not matched unless colorblind is in 
the corpus
* Data from the GraphQL API is fetched in batches with default being 10. This
 behavior can be modified with the `-s` flag

TpT has many users from US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
